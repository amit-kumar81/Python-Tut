## About Python:
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is widely used in various domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

 ## Key Feature:-
  * __Simple and Readable Syntax__: Python's syntax is designed to be clear and easy to understand, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers.
  * __Interpreted and Interactive__: Python is an interpreted language, which means that code is executed line by line. It also supports interactive mode, allowing for quick experimentation and prototyping.
  * __Dynamic Typing__: Python is dynamically typed, meaning we don't need to declare variable types explicitly. Variable types are determined at runtime.

## Getting Started:
 To start coding in Python, we will need to install the Python interpreter on our system. We can download the latest version of Python from the official website.
 ```

 ```
 Once installed, we can run Python code using the interactive interpreter.

 ## Learning Resources:
 There are numerous resources available for learning Python, including tutorials, documentation, books etc. Some recommended resources include:
   * [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): The official Python documentation provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and references for Python programming. 
   * [W3Schools Python Documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/): It offers beginner-friendly tutorials, concise reference pages, and interactive practice exercises with a browser-based code editor.
