# Operators:-
 Python has different types of operators for different operations. 
 1. __Arithmetic Operators__: Used for mathematical calculations:-
    * Addition: "+"
    * Subtraction: "-"
    * Multiplication: "*"
    * Division:"/"
    * Floor Division: "//" (division that truncates the decimal part)
    * Modulus: "%" (remainder of division)
    * Exponentiation: "**" (raising to a power)
 2. __Comparison Operators__: Used to compare values:-
    * Equal to: "=="
    * Not equal to: "!="
    * Greater than: ">"
    * Less than: "<"
    * Greater than or equal to: ">="
    * Less than or equal to: "<="
 3. __Logical Operators__: Used to perform logical operations on boolean values:-
    * AND: "and"
    * OR: "or"
    * NOT: "not"
 4. __Assignment Operators__: Used to assign values to variables:-
      * Assignment: "="
      * Add and assign: "+="
      * Subtract and assign: "-="
      * Multiply and assign: "*="
      * Divide and assign: "/="
      * Floor divide and assign: "//="
      * Modulus and assign: "%="
      * Exponentiation and assign: "**="
 5. __Identity Operators__: Used to compare the memory locations of two objects:-
      * is: "is"
      * is not: "is not"
6. __Bitwise Operators__: Used to perform bitwise operations on integers:-
     * Bitwise AND: "&"
      * Bitwise OR: "|"
      * Bitwise XOR: "^"
     *  Bitwise NOT: "~"
      * Left shift: "<<"
   * Right shift: ">>"

These operators form the backbone of Python's syntax and are used extensively in programming to perform various tasks and operations.
